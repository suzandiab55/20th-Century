# 20th-Century
## Objective 
Aims to explore various socio-economic and cultural trends of the 20th century using advanced data analysis techniques. By scraping web data, employing text mining, and applying natural language processing, the project seeks to uncover patterns and insights that shaped the century.
## Data 
This project leverages a variety of data sources, primarily historical texts, records, and publications from the 20th century, structured around:
- Socio-economic indicators
- Cultural artifacts
- Political documents
- Public and media archives
## Tools 
For this project, the following technologies and libraries were used:
- Python for general programming
- Beautiful Soup & Selenium for web scraping
- NLTK & spaCy for natural language processing
- NetworkX for network analysis
- Gephi for creating network visualizations
- Virtual Environments to manage dependencies
## Research Questions
This project addresses several research questions:

1) What are the key socio-economic trends that dominated the 20th century?
2) How did cultural movements and phenomena interconnect during this period?
3) What can the linguistic analysis of political documents tell us about global trends?
4) How can network analysis enhance our understanding of historical data?
## Data Cleaning Procedures
- Removed irrelevant or redundant data entries
- Standardized formats across different data sources
- Filled missing values and handled outliers
- Extracted and parsed textual data from complex formats
## Code
The complete source code and Jupyter notebooks used for analysis are stored within the repository and can be explored to replicate the study or explore further.
